</div>


## **Components Required :**

1. STM32 Nucleo Board
2. Wooden sticks
3. Mg90 Servo motors x2
4. 5v 1A Power Supply
5. Connecting Jumper wires
6. Glue gun and glue sticks

## **Working-**

After both Servo connections to STM32 board power supply of 5v 1A is provided and as per program the bottom servo motor will start rotating from 0°  to 180° and simultaneously vertically connected servo motor starts rotating from 0° to 120° which replicats the basic movement of 2 - DOF (degree of freedom) robotic arm.

## **Features-**

1. Efficient and effective working due to use of ARM controller
2. Simple in design with using wooden sticks as mechanical structure
3. 2 degree of freedom
4. 0° to 180° ratation of bottom servo motor
5. 0° to 120° rotation of vetical servo motor
6. 5v and 1A of Power requirements
