## **Components Required :**

1. STM32 Nucleo Board
2. Wooden sticks
3. Mg90 Servo motors x2
4. 5v 1A Power Supply
5. Connecting Jumper wires
6. Glue gun and glue sticks

## **Working-**

After both Servo connections to STM32 board power supply of 5v 1A is provided and as per program the bottom servo motor will start rotating from 0째  to 180째 and simultaneously vertically connected servo motor starts rotating from 0째 to 120째 which replicats the basic movement of 2 - DOF (degree of freedom) robotic arm.
